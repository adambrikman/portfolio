                        <p class="paragraph">I was born and raised in Las Vegas, NV. I graduated in 2015 with a Masters in Accounting. Shortly after graduating, I passed the CPA exams and began working at a top public accounting firm. While working at the firm, I stumbled across CS50, the free introductory CS course provided by Harvard Extension school. It was only after completing (and struggling!) through the first assigment in the C language that I realized I just spent a week of my spare time on 'homework' for enjoyment. It was then and there I decided I would complete course, no matter what.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-1-of-2">
                            <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-center-text u-margin-bottom-small">Fast-forward to now</h3>
                            <p class="paragraph">As dramatic as it sounds, CS50 changed my life. It was through the challenges in the course that I fell in love with programming. I couldn't believe there was a career where I could have the ability to make things (that weren't zero sum) and have critical thinking included in my work life. I began looking up what it would take to become a software engineer. I've since expanded my skills to delve further into responsive web design as well as both  front-end and back-end development. Below, you'll find a few of my projects. I sincerly hope you enjoy them.</p>
